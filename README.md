## Challenge:

Write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

- Creating Users
- Logging in
- Posting Peeps
- Viewing all Peeps _(I suggest you start here)_
- Viewing individual Peeps
- Deleting Peeps
- Liking Peeps
- Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.
