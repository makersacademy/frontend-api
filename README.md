# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

This is my version at the Makers Academy Frontend API challenge:

```
Write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.
Someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.
Build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API: https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend
```

The following features are implemented:

- User can view all peeps
- User can sign up
- User can log in

The next feature I would implement is to allow the user to post a peep.
