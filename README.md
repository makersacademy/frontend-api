# Rianne's Chitter 
# API Frontend Challenge
Weekend Challenge - Week 7 Makers Academy 

A small Twitter clone (a front-end single-page-app) that allows the users to post messages to a public stream.
A backend API has been provided and hosted on Heroku. 

The app has the following features:

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps 

I struggled with implementing pure javascript using the API and focussed on this rather than also trying to implement testing, therefore TDD not used. 

Assisted by my personal coach @Benaud12.
