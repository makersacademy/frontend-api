# Chitter API Challenge (front-end)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary

This is an incomplete project. This weekend challenge my intention was to explore a new framework, so I spent some time reading about React and trying to get to grips with it. While that was mostly successful, I was blocked by the testing and struggled to write any meaningful tests. Because I was aiming to stick to the TDD approach as much as possible this meant I haven't implemented much functionality as of Monday 13th Sep.

Currently, all a user can do is load the app and press a "refresh feed" button to see the 50 most recent peeps, the username who posted them, and the time they were created.
