The Chitter API frontend challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to try and test your knowledge of 'learning any new programming language'.

## Description
The program should be able to create users, log in, post peeps, view all peeps, view individual peeps, delete peeps, like peeps and unlike peeps. Not all of these features are required in submission, but well tested, easy to read and easy to change code must be produced.

## Installation
You will need to open `index.html` in your browser.

## Roadmap
A future release may include the functionality of logging out, deleting peeps, liking peeps, and unliking peeps.

## Project status
This project has been partly completed. I have struggled in following a TDD process in this challenge as I don't understand enough about how to write testable code using jQuery and Ajax. This is something I need some more guidance on.
