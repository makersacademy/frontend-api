# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

A front-end single-page-app that interfaces with [the pre-built "Chitter" API](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend).
This small Twitter clone should allow users to post messages to a public stream.

Implemented interactions supported by the API
-------

- [x] Viewing all Peeps.
    - [x] Display author of Peep.
    - [x] Display date and time of Peep, formatted from ISO to locale.
- [ ] Viewing individual Peeps.
- [ ] Creating Users.
- [ ] Logging in.
- [ ] Posting Peeps.
- [ ] Deleting Peeps.
- [ ] Liking Peeps.
- [ ] Unliking Peeps.

Well tested, easy to read, easy to change code is more important than the number of implemented interactions.

Notes
---

- Test coverage is low as I struggled to keep a TDD approach.
- Added basic Bootstrap styling.
