## What I've learned & need to improve:

Having very limited time completing this weekend challenge I wanted to focus on interacting with the return key values from the given API.
I was unsure on how to write tests in this context and tried to TDD with good planning and sudo code instead
Keen on implementig more userstories in the coming days

## Implementation

I would like to post a peep

As a user
That I can fully indulge into the gossip & trauma that’s happening on Zwitscher
I would like to view & read all peeps

As a user
