The Chitter API frontend challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to try and test your knowledge of *'learning any new programming language'*.

## Description
The program should be able to create users, log in, post peeps, view all peeps, view individual peeps, delete peeps, like peeps and unlike peeps. Not all of these features are required in submission, but well tested, easy to read and easy to change code must be produced.

## Installation

## Roadmap
*A future release may include the functionality of logging in and out Chitter in order to post a peep and receiving an email if the user is tagged in a peep.*
