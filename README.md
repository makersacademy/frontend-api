# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

A front-end single-page-app that interfaces with [the pre-built "Chitter" API](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend).
This small Twitter clone should allow users to post messages to a public stream.

Implemented interactions supported by the API
-------

- [ ] Viewing all Peeps
- [ ] Viewing individual Peeps
- [ ] Creating Users
- [ ] Logging in
- [ ] Posting Peeps
- [ ] Deleting Peeps
- [ ] Liking Peeps
- [ ] Unliking Peeps

Well tested, easy to read, easy to change code is more important than the number of implemented interactions.
