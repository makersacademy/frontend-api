# Chitter API Challenge

This was a challenge to build a Twitter clone that connected to a backend REST API. Users were able to sing up, log in and then post messages to a public stream. Having completed the challenge I have a much better understanding of how to write and test asynchoronous code in Javascript, as well as use of fetch and the most common RESTful methods like POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE. 

Language - Javscript
Testing - Jest 

## Requirements

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps
