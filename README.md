# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

* This is my implementation of this coding challenge: https://github.com/makersacademy/frontend-api-challenge

## How to use
 * Clone the project
 * Open ```index.html```
 * To run unit tests, open ```SpecRunner.html```


## Notes
 * Current functionality: Register, login, create a peep
 * Was working on implementing the peep list - model and persister done, not integrated with page yet.
 * Using jQuery and loosely basing structure on https://github.com/maryrosecook/count
 * Unit testing for model & persisters using Jasmine
 * Had a limited time for this challenge as I'm away this weekend
 * Considered using Ruby with Capybara for UI/acceptance testing but decided I would learn more in limited time by continuing with the implementation
 * Focusing on functionality rather than styling
