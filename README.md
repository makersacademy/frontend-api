# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

## The challenge

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

## Planning 

### User stories

*To be implemented*

```
As a user
So I can see what other people are sharing online
I want to  view all the peeps

As a user
So I see what a specific user has posted
I want to view an entire single tweet

As a user
So I can share what I am thinking online
I want to be able to post a tweet
```
