Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
```
As a member of the public
I'd like to create a Chitter Account
So I can use Chitter
```
* Logging in
```
As a User
I'd like to Log In
So I can post a peep
```
* Posting Peeps
```
As a User
I'd like to Post a Peep
So I can share my thoughts
```
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
```
As a User
I'd like to view all Peeps
So I can see what others are posting
```
* Viewing individual Peeps
```
As a User
I'd like to view individual Peeps
So I can focus on one post
```
* Deleting Peeps
```
As a User
I'd like to delete Peeps
So I can remove mistakes or embarassing peeps
```
* Liking Peeps
```
As a User
I'd like to like Peeps
So I can show my appreciation for a good post
```
* Unliking Peeps
```
As a User
I'd like to unlike Peeps
So I can remove an accidental Like
```

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Utilities you might find useful

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
