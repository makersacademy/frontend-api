# Chitter API Frontend Challenge
[INSERT SCREEN SHOT WHEN AVAILABLE]

## What does the code do?

A small Twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except it uses a pre-existing backend API.

## Training focus for this challenge

My aim this weekend is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with an external API. 
[The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

I chose this challenge to get more practice with:
 - Javascript SPAs
 - External API integration
 - User login / authentication

Here's a model of how I planned the entities to interact to load the landing page:
