# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

Makers Academy Week 7 - weekend challenge
Chitter Javascript front end

#### Summary

This was an interesting experience!

This is a single page web app where I built the front end entirely out of Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. The only library I used was the Jasmine Testing library and I used for one test my own testing library - Is It Ducking Working?

Features of the WebApp:
- Display peeps
- signup and login
- post a peep and display it on the page

I had a tricky time developing this test first, so I did a mish mash of writing code and writing tests. It was very tricky to write mocked tests.
- I succesfully developed three mocked tests for the peeps display, signup and login.
- I did not get around to testing the posting of peeps.

#### To use:
- git clone
- run index.html in your webbrowswer
- to see the tests run SpecRunner.html
- to see my one passing test for Duck testing run DuckTestRunner.html

#### Thoughts:

I was happy with my ability to succesfully mock the tests and also with being able to split up some of the functions between app.js and interface.js.

Things I found very difficult:
- Setting up the tests, these required a lot of prep work and were difficult to write without working on the actual code as well.
- Asynchronous Functions, I was trying to past the results of the post requests to the app.js but I could not figure out how to get the functions to wait for the return.

Things I did not get around to:
- implementing all the features (likes, deleting peeps, seeing one peep in particular)
- CSS



Original Instructions
-----

* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Challenge:
-------

As usual please start by forking this repo.

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Utilities you might find useful

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
