# Chitter API Frontend Challenge


Challenge:
-------

We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge), except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. [The API documentation is here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend)

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

* Creating Users
* Logging in
* Posting Peeps
* Viewing all Peeps *(I suggest you start here)*
* Viewing individual Peeps
* Deleting Peeps
* Liking Peeps
* Unliking Peeps


## Approach
- TDD driven. first write feature and unit tests for each user story which relates to the interaction above. 

### User stories
As a user, I am able to view all peeps on the page

As a user, I am able to view individual peeps

As a user, I am able to post a peep

As a user, I am able to delete a peep

As a user, I am able to create a new user account 

As a user, I am able to log in to my account

As a user, I am able to like a peep

As a user, I am able to unlike a peep



### Skills 
- writting code that is easy to read and change
- write code that is well tested
















## Other notes

We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.


## Utilities

* [The Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for exploring the API.
