# Chitter API Frontend Challenge

This challenge involved creating a web-app for 'Chitter' using JavaScript, applying what we have learned in the previous week. It was an excellent challenge, integrating 'fetch' HTTP requests and manipulation of this data with dynamic HTML.

It certainly raised lots of questions on efficiency and code structure... JQuery and ReactJS seem like interesting frameworks to use in the future, to simplify my code and improve its readability.

## Tech used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* HTTP request with Fetch
* Testing via Jest

### Pictures of functionality

1. Home page with dynamic login, sticky navbar, and view of all peeps on the page.

2. Once logged in, a user has a unique 'session id' which allows them to access various features, including:
- Posting a peep
- Deleting an existing peep that they have written
- Liking other peeps
