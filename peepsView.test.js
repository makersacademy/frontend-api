Go through steps from week challenge about creating a view model
and


You can take it into even smaller pieces. You could just say, 
I want to view one peep. No api. Implement that. 
Then you can say, I want to view 10 peeps (no api) and do that. 
Then you could say, I'll get the peeps from the api. 
So the api can come later after you've built the view and models
